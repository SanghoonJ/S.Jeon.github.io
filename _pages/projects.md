## 1. In-sleep Stroke Early-Detection
***
Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United State. More than 140,000 people die each year from stroke in the United States, and the risk of having a stroke is more than doubles each decade after the age of 55. Problem is that stroke could happen during sleep. To prevent and early treatment of the stroke, we analyze sleep motion and provide in-sleep stroke detection system


## 2. Sleep Position Tracking System 
***
Most of existing sleep trackers merely show quantitative information about sleep patterns and duration at each sleep stage overlooking the importance of sleep positions upon sleep qualities. To have sound sleep, one has to avoid bad sleep positions associated with health conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea, sudden infant death syndrome, pregnancy, snoring, and so on.


## 3. Automatic Stroke Driver Assessment 
***
Although many stroke survivors are not fully capable of driving, they drive again without any formal assessment due to an absence of valid screening tools. This leads to an elevated risk of accidents. Although an on-road test is considered a standard assessment method for items relevant to actual driving, it may be dangerous to evaluate all stroke drivers with the on-road test. For safe pre-screening of unsuitable stroke drivers, we propose an automatic Driving Performance Assessment System for Stroke drivers
